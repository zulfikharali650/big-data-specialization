# Big Data Specialiazation UCSD (Coursera)

This repository contains most of my work for the Big Data Specialiazation on Coursera. The course covers a wide range of topics in Big data, specifically Spark and Hadoop. The repository includes most of the code and data that I used for the course, as well as solutions to the exercises. I hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for other students who are taking the course or who are interested in learning more about data science.

The folders are structured by each courses name.
